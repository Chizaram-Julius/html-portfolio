<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Julius Chizaram Onyinyechukwu. I am a twin, and my sister is a backend web developer. 
  What inspired me to pursue skills as a full-stack web developer is my desire to expand my knowledge in the world of tech.
</p> 
<p>So far, I have learned HTML heading elements, HTML paragraph elements, self closing tags (void elements), list elements (ordered and unordered lists), nesting & indentation, anchor elements (alongside its attributes), image elements (alongside its attributes), File paths (Absolute and relative paths), bulding multi-page websites and HTML boilerplate and am currently building my portfolio. 
</p>
<p>The journey has been rewarding. Balancing studying with work has been fascinating, and I am deeply grateful to God for always strengthening me to continue learning and burning the midnight oil.
</p>
